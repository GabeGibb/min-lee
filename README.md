# Project Setup

To run the project, you need to have two terminals open:

1. **Frontend Setup:**

-   Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
-   Install dependencies and start the development server:
    ```sh
    pnpm i
    pnpm run dev
    ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

-   Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
-   Install dependencies and start the development server:
    ```sh
    pnpm i
    pnpm run dev
    ```

## Notes

-   Make sure you have pnpm installed globally
